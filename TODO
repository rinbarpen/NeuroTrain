Overall:
 - [x] Test to train
 - [x] Test to test
 - [x] Test to predict

Train:
 - [x] Add Mean-Epoch-Metric for every class
 - [x] the score from Mean-Metric for every class may be a fault
 - [x] The image of Mean-Metric on classes is error 
 - [x] Support the Trainer, Tester and Predictor to be inherited

Analyzer:
